# The makings of Feline the Wild West
### Created by Marly Saliba, Nour Hoballah, Dolena Nguyen
#### The Contribution Board for this project does not represent the true commitment of each team member. Since the entire project had to be done on a single computer only one commit was done at the end of the project resulting in false contribution data.

## Inspiration
The inspiration for "Feline the Wild West" was mostly a love for cats as well as the theme of this year's Conuhacks which is the West. Also, every member of this team loves games like Call of Duty therefore we decided to take on the challenge of merging all of these together.

## What it does
The game we developed places the user as a cat character by the name of Shadowclaw and makes him defeat the evil Sir MeowsAlot to save the Wild West in a 1v1 gun battle. They both keep battling until one loses his life.

## How we built it
To make this dream a reality we had to use the platform Unity to be able to have a background layout as well as a character that we could use to move and create obstacles as well as put the whole game together. Then, using c# as a coding language we successfully gave each piece of the game its own special function.

## Challenges we ran into
Many challenges were met during the development of the video game, such as cartwheeling characters, flying characters, immortal characters, and many more. It being our first time using Unity, we had to learn on the go, and that caused us a lot more problems than we had expected.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are first and foremost proud of the challenge we have accomplished, even though it is our first time ever attempting something of the sort. Also, we are proud of everything we have learned over the past 24 hours as a team and as individual players. However, above all, we are proud of having decided to even take on the project.

## What we learned
We learned many new things about programming that we did not know about before entering the competition like Unity, c#, Image motion integration and more. We also learned that you shouldn't be afraid of taking on a new challenge just because you lack experience. Experience is something you acquire by doing things like this, it will never be handed out for free.

## What's next for Feline the Wild West
Hopefully, we can make our characters mortal and stop them from levitating in the middle of the game. However, after that who knows maybe the day will come when the Wild West's Felines finally meet the dreaded Canines.
